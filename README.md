# Eyeball

Code an Eye in Processing
CREATIVE  CODING CLASS | PADILLA | ALHS | 2018


# GOALS For This Assignment

1. Practicing using Processing 
2. Practice using the ”ellipse” command in Processing 
3. Understand draw order and command ordering 
4. Understand the Processing 2D coordinate systems 
5. Make a picture of a Eyeball! 



# REQUIREMENTS 

You must create an image using Processing of an Eyeball. 

Your ‘sketch’ of the eyeball must: 

• be created using at least 5 ellipses
• be of size 400 by 400 pixels 
• be in color 

For example:






# RESOURCES 
Some of this information will help you on your lab. 

Use only the following commands - where you need to figure out what numbers to plug in to get the desired behaviour: 

1. ellipse(?, ?, ? , ?) 
( x, y coordinates, width, height )
2. size(?, ?) 

Note that when drawing a shape you can control some of its properties. 

Commands that are useful are: 

• stroke(r, g, b); ( 0-255, 0-255, 0-255 )
• fill(r, g, b); 
• noStroke();


# OPTIONAL Challenge

Code a set of Crossed-Eye eyeballs, experiment with color and size. 


# NAMING Convention

“YOURFIRSTNAME(allcaps).Eyeball.Drawing”
“ . “ periods in between words


# SAVE an image of your Eyeball 

Cut and Paste this function into the LAST line of your code to save an image ( .png file format ) to your sketch folder.


//save function
save(“YOURFIRSTNAME(allcaps).Eyeball.Drawing.png");
